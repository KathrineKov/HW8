Task 1: Sorting 3 variables using no more than 3 simple if 

What I learned: 
I learned how to sort 3 variables using only 3 simple if statements. This helped me understand 
the value of minimalism and efficiency in coding without resorting to complex logic.

How I can use it in future work: 
The ability to minimize complexity and write optimal code will be useful when working with large
datasets, especially when writing algorithms that need to maintain high performance.

Task 2: Counting strings in a list with elements of different types

What I learned: 
I learned how to iterate through a list with elements of different types and count the number of
strings using Pythonâ€™s type() function. 

How I can use it in future work: 
I can apply this technique to data cleaning and validation tasks, where it's important to differentiate 
between data types and handle them accordingly. 

Overall Conclusion:
By mastering type checking, conditionals, and simple algorithms, I can better handle data transformations 
and contribute to more efficient and effective analytics solutions in my future work.
